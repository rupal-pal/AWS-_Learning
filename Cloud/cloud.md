## What is Cloud?

Cloud is the on-demand delivery of resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, 
such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
